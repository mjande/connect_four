# Connect Four

## Description

This program runs a script that allows two players to play a game of Connect Four on the command line. The project was completed as part of the curriculum at [The Odin Project] (www.theodinproject.com). The underlying purpose of this project was to practice using Test-Driven Development as a way to develop a simple program. That process proved to be a bit more intensive than projects of a similar scope, but it did lead to better organization and confidence. Overall, I learned not only how to use testsof behavior to drive method and class creation, but using this style of development also helped me structure my code more clearly, and use encapsulation to make the code easier to change later on. As the logic of the program got more and more complex, with the test already written it became simple to make changes and ensure that these changes wouldn't break any aspect of the program. using TDD and RSpec testing has made my code cleaner and improved my organizational skills (in creating code) as a programmer.

## Usage

Connect Four is meant to be run on the command line. A user should run the main.rb file, and we prompted for all input throughout the game. A board will be printed to command lines between turns.
